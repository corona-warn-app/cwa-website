## About this Repository
This repository contains the source files of the official website for the Corona-Warn-App as it is available at [coronawarn.app](https://coronawarn.app). For information about the project, please see our [documentation repository](https://github.com/corona-warn-app/cwa-documentation).

## Development

### Requirements

You need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) and [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) to build the website. Optionally, you need an HTTP Server such as [http-server](https://github.com/http-party/http-server) to run and test it locally.

### Getting started

Clone the repository and ensure to have all requirements installed. To build the website, switch to the ```cwa-website``` base directory and execute the commands

```bash
  npm install
  gulp build
```

After a successful build, you'll have a new folder ```public``` in the repository's base directory. It contains the generated files for the complete website. To test the generated content, simply use a local web server such as http-server by executing the command 

```bash
  http-server
```
It will automatically use ```public``` as base directory, go to ```localhost:8080``` to view the website.

### Testing
[Cypress](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/overview/why-cypress.html#In-a-nutshell) is used to run End-To-End tests. tests are located in the ```cypress/integration``` folder and can be run with:
```bash
  npm test
```


### Updating coronawarn.app

Any direct commits and merged pull requests will automatically trigger follow-up actions to build and deploy the changes to [coronawarn.app](https://coronawarn.app). The respective [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) are available in the [.github/workflows](.github/workflows) directory of this repository.

## Documentation

## How to contribute  

The German government has asked SAP and Deutsche Telekom AG to develop the Corona-Warn-App for Germany as open source software. Deutsche Telekom is providing the network and mobile technology and will operate and run the backend for the app in a safe, scalable and stable manner. SAP is responsible for the app development, its framework and the underlying platform. Therefore, development teams of SAP and Deutsche Telekom are contributing to this project. At the same time our commitment to open source means that we are enabling -in fact encouraging- all interested parties to contribute and become part of its developer community.
