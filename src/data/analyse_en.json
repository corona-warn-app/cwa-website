The delay may occur as follows:<br />The user takes more time to share his or her test result. As soon as the result is shared, the number of shared results changes accordingly regarding the scan or call date.<br />The user already receives a QR code when making their appointment and scans it immediately, although he or she may not have the test performed until later.</p><strong>Additional information</strong><p>Only positive test results are relevant for ending chains of infection. To prevent abuse, positive test results must be verified. There are two options for verifying test results: a QR code or a teleTAN, which must be entered in the Corona-Warn-App. The user receives the QR code when the sample for the test is collected. By scanning the QR code, the test can be registered in the Corona-Warn-App. As soon as the result is available, it is automatically retrieved and displayed on the smartphone. The user can then decide to release her/his own random codes from the last 14 days to warn possible risk contacts. If no QR code is available or if it is lost, the user can call the verification hotline. A teleTAN is generated there to verify the positive test result. This teleTAN must be entered into the app by the user.<br />Since version 3.0 of the Corona-Warn-App from February 18, 2023, it is possible to warn others due to an unvalidated positive PCR or rapid antigen test (incl. self-testing). Calling the verification hotline to assign teleTANs after a positive test result that was not submitted to the CWA is no longer necessary since that date. The verification hotline was still available until January 31, 2023 to ensure a transition period for those who had not yet updated the CWA to version 3.0.</p>"
