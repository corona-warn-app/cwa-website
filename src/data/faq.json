In the pandemic, they therefore need reliable access management for business premises, factory halls, aircraft, trams, hotels and restaurants or events for instance. They need to be able to verify the authenticity of Digital COVID Certificates (DCCs) quickly and easily. This is served by a Validation Service.  The Federal Ministry of Health (Bundesministerium für Gesundheit, BMG) has decided to enable several validation services after appropriate verification.",
                            "<b>When does a DCC validation service bring advantages over the certificate check with the CovPassCheck-App, for example?</b>",
                            "The advantage can be seen, for example, in the purchase of an event ticket. If the buyer requires a valid certificate for the event visit, they can carry out the certificate check immediately upon purchase. The certificate check at the event location is omitted. This saves waiting times, avoids long queues at the entrance control and ultimately contributes to reducing the risk of infection. If the service is accessed directly from the Corona-Warn-App or, in the future, from the CovPass-App, it makes it possible to validate the DCC without having to upload it to the ticket provider. Thus, the service contributes to the most data-saving use of the DCCs.",

This checks the certificate for validity and only transmits the result of the check (not the certificate itself) back to the buyer and the event organizer. The latter authorizes the purchase of the ticket after successful verification. This allows the customer to successfully complete the purchase.",
                            "The check is technically similar to the procedure of the CovPassCheck-App. Only that the check does not run on the check app, but on a validation server.

For this purpose, data is stored in encrypted form and the program code of the app is made available for public review (<a href='#open-source' target='_blank' >open source approach</a>). In order to realize data encryption for an app, developers like to fall back on program modules that have already been tried and tested in the past and are also made available as open source by other developers. This way, transparency for all components of the Corona-Warn-App can be guaranteed. Only recently it became known that an encryption module, which is also used by the Corona-Warn-App, works incorrectly if the memory for keys or passwords integrated in the Android operating system does not react reliably. This error leads to the fact that an encrypted database can no longer be opened. This in turn causes some users to see the message „<a href='#cause9002' target='_blank' >Cause: 9002 Something went wrong (sqlite)</a>“ or <a href='#app_crash' target='_blank' >the app can no longer be opened</a>.

Therefore, this aspect of the risk assessment depends largely on physical location of the involved smartphones and on spatial conditions.",

The validity of the certificate ends 1 year after issuance. <br/><br/> <b>Vaccination Certificate</b> <br/>In the certificate data is transported, in this case information about vaccination. This vaccination took place on a date X and is valid from then (according to the current state of scientific knowledge) e.g., in Germany 1 year. After that the vaccination protection has expired. We call the duration of the vaccination protection 'effective (vaccination) validity'. So, the effective validity of the vaccination counts from the last vaccination date (date X).  <br/><br/> <b>Certificate of Recovery</b> <br/> According to the <a href='https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Genesenennachweis.html' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'> RKI </a>, the maximum effective validity of a certificate of recovery is 90 days. <br/><br/> <b>Test Certificate</b> <br/>Test certificates are usually issued with a technical validity of 2 days. How long such a test result is accepted depends on the federal state. Typically, in Germany, negative PCR test results are accepted for 48 hours and rapid test results for 24 hours. <br/><br/>A certificate is valid until either the technical validity or the effective validity expires."
