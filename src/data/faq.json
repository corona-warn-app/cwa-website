For this purpose, data is stored in encrypted form and the program code of the app is made available for public review (<a href='#open-source' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>open source approach</a>). In order to realize data encryption for an app, developers like to fall back on program modules that have already been tried and tested in the past and are also made available as open source by other developers. This way, transparency for all components of the Corona-Warn-App can be guaranteed. Only recently it became known that an encryption module, which is also used by the Corona-Warn-App, works incorrectly if the memory for keys or passwords integrated in the Android operating system does not react reliably. This error leads to the fact that an encrypted database can no longer be opened. This in turn causes some users to see the message „<a href='#cause9002' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Cause: 9002 Something went wrong (sqlite)</a>“ or <a href='#app_crash' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>the app can no longer be opened</a>.
