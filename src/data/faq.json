The determination of the distance is also influenced by the orientation of the two smartphone antennas to each other. Therefore, the result of the risk calculation also depends on the exact spatial location and orientation of the smartphones involved. The environment (reflecting or absorbing surfaces) can also influence the range of the BLE signal, so that different values for contact duration and signal attenuation (distance) can be received depending on the orientation of the smartphones.",

Examples of such processes are risk calculation and the loading of positive keys that takes place several times a day when WiFi access is available. But the search for other smartphones with active CWA is also such a background process.",
                                    "Furthermore, the CWA supports different versions of the Exposure Notification Framework (ENF) (depending on the version number of the app and the operating system used). This is developed and provided by Google and Apple. Since not every smartphone supports the latest version of the ENF, different ENF versions can lead to different risk calculations.",
                                    "Additionally, in the risk calculation, several low-risk encounters over the course of a day can lead to the display of an encounter with increased risk.

                                    "In addition, smartphones react differently with regard to transmission power/signal strength and reception sensitivity due to different technical equipment (hardware) and system software.

However, regardless of the vaccine used, a waiting period of 14 days is always required after the last vaccination of the basic immunization, since full vaccine protection is only given after the formation of a sufficient amount of antibodies.",
                                    "As a result, checking apps, such as the CovPassCheck-App, cannot distinguish whether the second vaccination procedure is a booster vaccination for the J&J basic immunization, or the second dose of the basic immunization.

                                    "On the other hand, in case of a previous basic immunization by two doses, the booster vaccination is declared as the third of three vaccinations.

As soon as a second booster vaccination is given after the basic immunization by the J&J vaccine, the display of the fourteen-day waiting period is omitted, since \"3 of 3\" is entered as the number of the vaccination for this certificate.",

                                    "<h4>Technical background</h4> The Corona-Warn-App was developed with the highest standards of data protection. For this purpose, data is stored in encrypted form and the program code of the app is made available for public review (<a href='#open-source' target='_blank' >open source approach</a>). In order to realize data encryption for an app, developers like to fall back on program modules that have already been tried and tested in the past and are also made available as open source by other developers. This way, transparency for all components of the Corona-Warn-App can be guaranteed. Only recently it became known that an encryption module, which is also used by the Corona-Warn-App, works incorrectly if the memory for keys or passwords integrated in the Android operating system does not react reliably. This error leads to the fact that an encrypted database can no longer be opened. This in turn causes some users to see the message „<a href='#cause9002' target='_blank' >Cause: 9002 Something went wrong (sqlite)</a>“ or <a href='#app_crash' target='_blank' >the app can no longer be opened</a>. Of course, the Corona-Warn-App is thoroughly tested before each release of an update. However, this error never occurred during the tests and it is still difficult to reproduce.",
