From an epidemiological point of view, the processes of contact tracing can be accelerated by the Corona-Warn-App as it supports informing people at risk faster. As a result, possible infection chains can be detected and interrupted earlier. This can also help to relax existing restrictions in order to return social life to normal. In addition to the decisive hygiene and behavioural rules to prevent an infection and many other measures, such as the expansion of tests or better contact tracking by health authorities, the Corona-Warn-App is therefore a further element in the fight against the Corona pandemic."

                        "In April 2020, a scientific debate had developed, which was conducted in public under the keyword \"centralized vs. decentralized storage\". In addition to arguments that were comprehensible in terms of content, a partly ideological debate on centralised storage developed, which had the potential to jeopardise confidence in this technological approach. A loss of confidence in the general public would have endangered all efforts and endeavours to be able to detect chains of infection earlier and interrupt them more quickly with digital support. For this reason, the Federal Government took action and adapted the project philosophy in the sense of a decentralized approach."
