        "intro": "The app now allows a check-in for events and locations. People who host events or have a business can now create a QR code. By scanning the QR code, guests can check in upon arrival to register their presence. If desired, the app will also create a corresponding diary entry. If a checked-in person later tests positive for the coronavirus, other people who were checked in at the same time can be warned.",
        "introCLI": " You can create QR codes in the app or here on this page. Alternatively, you can also use <a href='https://github.com/corona-warn-app/cwa-event-qr-code'>our official QR code utility</a> to generate several QR codes at once, for example.",
        "disclaimer": "All information is processed only locally in your browser. Neither the QR codes you generate nor the information they contain are sent to the Corona-Warn-App servers. The source code of the generator is freely available for viewing.",
