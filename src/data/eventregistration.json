By scanning the QR code, guests can check in upon arrival to register their presence. If desired, the app will also create a corresponding diary entry. If a checked-in person later tests positive for the coronavirus, other people who were checked in at the same time can be warned.",
        "introCLI": " You can create QR codes in the app or here on this page. Alternatively, you can also use <a href='https://github.com/corona-warn-app/cwa-event-qr-code'>our official QR code utility</a> to generate several QR codes at once, for example. <a href='../event-qr-code-guide/'>Click here</a> for a detailed guide on how to use the official QR code utility.",
