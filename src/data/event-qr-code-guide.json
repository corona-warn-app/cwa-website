If you plan to rename the sample file based on your intended use, keep in mind that you will then need to use your own file name instead of 'tables.csv'. If you have already used the batch file, have adjusted your data and want to create new QR Codes, but have <b>not</b> changed the name of the .csv file, run the batch file again with a double click. If you have changed the name of the .csv file, there are the following ways to adjust the batch file to it. Either open the command prompt (see step 2) and enter these two comma-separated lines one by one: '<b>cd /d %USERPROFILE%/Downloads/event-qr-codes, generateEventQRCodes.bat FILENAME.csv</b>', or edit the batch file and replace the name where 'tables.csv' is with your file name."
