The CWA rapid test portal allows you to easily connect your rapid tests into the CWA if you do not already have test management software in use. This solution has basic functionalities such as the digital recording of the proband's personal data and test results, and also automatically transmits findings to the CWA if the proband has consented to this. The prerequisite for using the web-based portal is the availability of internet-capable end devices and an internet connection at the test site. Access is via web browsers (e.g. Firefox, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge, Safari, etc.). Using the CWA rapid test portal, you can handle tests for all probands, no matter if it's with or without CWA. A video introduction on how to administer users and groups in the quick test portal can be found on <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAwPuVZBF3U' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' title=''>YouTube</a>.
