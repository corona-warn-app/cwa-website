# Website Content Change

The Website is created from a set of pages, templates, and json data using [panini](https://github.com/foundation/panini).

## Finding the right page

In case you have to change some aspect of the page, a good approach is working your way back from the URL:

* In [the pages folder](../src/pages/), the URL path is directly reflected
* There's one folder for each language (en/de)
* Each folder contains further subfolders for individually addressable pages (/blog, /faq, etc.)

## The right template

The HTML files in the page folders are not really html but a mix of markdown and Panini templates.

The markdown entry "layout" referes to a file in the [layouts folder](../src/layouts/).

The entry below the header defines which page content is rendered how.
Let's consider the following example `{{> page-community page-contents=community_de}}`:

* page-community refers to a partial named page-community.html in the [partials folder](../src/partials/)
* page-contents will be a variable that can be used in the partial
* Its value is set to community_de, which refers to a file in the [data folder](../src/data/)

Within the partial, the different data elements become part of an HTML structure, e.g., by using it as a child (text) of an HTML tag, defining class names, etc.

Partials can also call other partials using a similar snippet as used above.

## Keep in mind

This is a rather random list of things to keep in mind when altering content:

* Partials are language independent, data is not
* For every change, you probably have to change two data files (on for each language)
* English is the "main" language, i.e., {stuff}.json should contain the english text, {stuff}_de.json the german text
* Use a proper JSON formatter after making your changes (e.g. the format document option of VSCode) from time to time
