In close cooperation with Apple, the developers could fix the [problem in Apple’s iOS 13.7 operating system](/en/blog/2020-09-10-ios-13-bug/) that was identified a few days ago. Affected users should now receive a correctly calculated risk assessment under iOS 13.7 again.
The adjustments were made directly on the server. This means that the Corona-Warn-App does not have to be updated and users do not have to do anything.
