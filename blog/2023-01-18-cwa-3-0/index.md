The project team of the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), Deutsche Telekom, and SAP have **released version 3.0 of the Corona-Warn-App (CWA)**. With this update, users of the app can now warn others after a positive self-test. Calling the verification hotline to issue teleTANs after a positive test result that was not transmitted to the CWA is no longer necessary. Therefore, the operation of the verification hotline will be discontinued as of 31.01.2023.

<!-- overview -->

As a result of the expected further course of the pandemic, the testing and warning concept of the Corona-Warn-App will be adapted to the changed testing behavior of the population and made easier for users.

Previously, an official positive rapid or PCR test in the CWA was required in order to initiate a warning via the Corona-Warn-App. With version 3.0, the Corona-Warn-App (CWA) has a new feature: Warnings are now also possible after a positive self-test. Users with a positive test result can initiate a warning through the CWA by themselves. This applies both to positive results of PCR tests and rapid antigen tests officially issued in testing centers that have not been transmitted to the CWA, and to positive results of point-of-care PCR tests (rapid PCR tests) and self-tests.

A call to the verification hotline for the issuance of teleTANs after a positive test result that was not transmitted to the CWA is thus no longer necessary. Therefore, the operation of the verification hotline will be discontinued as of 31.01.2023.

### Warn once every three months at the most

Users of non-updated versions of the Corona-Warn-App who still see the option "Request TAN for PCR Test" in the outdated version of the app will be informed of the transition to the new TAN-less warning procedure via a recorded message when they call the verification hotline.

Users of the Corona-Warn-App can initiate a maximum of one warning within a period of three months. This is intended to limit possible misuse of the new function.

For the app's core functions risk identification and risk warning, nothing will change in Germany as a result of the switch to the TAN-less warning procedure. The app continues to function as usual and has proven itself.

Version 3.0, like previous versions, will be rolled out to all users in stages over 48 hours. iOS users can now download the latest app version manually from the Apple Store. The Google Play Store does not offer the option of triggering a manual update. The new version of the Corona-Warn-App will be available to users here within the next 48 hours.

For the latest information on the roll-out and the CWA, please follow the Twitter channel of [#coronawarnapp](https://twitter.com/coronawarnapp) (German only).
