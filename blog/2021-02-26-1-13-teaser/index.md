Deutsche Telekom and SAP’s project team will release the Corona-Warn-App’s next update in the coming days. With version 1.13, users will be able to donate data to the Robert Koch-Institut voluntarily via the app. Based on that, the experts can further improve the app.

Additionally, users who have a red tile, i.e. an increased risk, will see a link to a scientific survey by the Robert Koch-Institut. By taking part in the survey, users can help the experts to analyze and better understand the app’s effectiveness. Detailed information on the update will be available here as soon as the project team has published version 1.13.
