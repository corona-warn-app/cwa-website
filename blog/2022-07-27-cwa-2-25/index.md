The project team of the Robert Koch-Institute (RKI), Deutsche Telekom, and SAP have **released version 2.25 of the Corona-Warn-App (CWA).** The team has updated the **guidelines on what to do in case of a low or increased risk** (red as well as green tile) correspondent to the [recommendations of the RKI](https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Quarantaene/Absonderung.html;jsessionid=EE3180A1446820CBF8BFC7BC793F763A.internet062?nn=13490888) (German only). Among other things, this involves recommendations on contact restriction and wearing masks. In addition, the project team has made improvements and small adjustments. 

Given the current pandemic situation, it is still useful and important to use the CWA and its functions, especially to warn others.

Version 2.25, like previous versions, will be rolled out to all users in stages over 48 hours. iOS users can now download the latest app version manually from the Apple Store. The Google Play Store does not offer the option of triggering a manual update. The new version of the Corona-Warn-App will be available to users here within the next 48 hours.

Up-to-date information on the status of the roll-out can be found on the Twitter channel of [#coronawarnapp](https://twitter.com/coronawarnapp) (German only).
