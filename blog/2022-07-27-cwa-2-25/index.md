The project team of the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), Deutsche Telekom, and SAP have **released version 2.25 of the Corona-Warn-App (CWA).** The team has updated the **guidelines on what to do in case of a low or increased risk** (red as well as green tile) corresponding to the [recommendations of the RKI](https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Quarantaene/Absonderung.html) (German only). Among other things, this involves recommendations on contact restriction and wearing masks. In addition, the project team has made improvements and small adjustments. 

Given the current pandemic situation, it is still useful and important to use the CWA and its functions, especially to warn others.
