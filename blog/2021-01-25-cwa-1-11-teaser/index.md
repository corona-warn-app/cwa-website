With the next update to version 1.11, the Corona-Warn-App will contain some bug fixes and improvements, as well as statistics that give an overview of current key figures on the infection numbers in Germany. 
 
<!-- overview -->

The appâ€™s more than 25 million users will then be able to see the number of new infections, the 7-day incidence rates and the 7-day R-value, as well as the number of people who have warned their fellow citizens via the app. The goal is to encourage even more users who have tested positive to share their test result and warn others. Furthermore, the developers have improved the usability by having fixed some minor bugs.

The new version 1.11 is currently in beta testing and will be available for download later this week. Then, you can find more detailed information about the update in this blog.
