Version 1.2.1 of the Corona-Warn-App has been released in the Apple App Store. The update fixes an [error](https://www.coronawarn.app/en/faq/#app_does_not_open) which caused the app to crash or prevented some users from opening the app. Therefore, we recommend all iOS-users to update the app to version 1.2.1.
