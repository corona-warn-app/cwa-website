The Corona-Warn-App development team was informed by a GitHub Security Lab employee about a weak spot in the Corona-Warn-App server (CWA Server, version 1.5). The team closed this gap with version 1.5.1 of the server four days after it was announced. The current version is 1.6.0.
The quick rectification of the weak spot clearly shows that the open source and community process works well and contributes significantly to the security of the Corona-Warn-App operation.
