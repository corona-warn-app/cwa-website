We recommend iOS users to upgrade the operating system to iOS 13.6.1 as it improves interaction with the Corona-Warn-App.
<!-- overview -->

The update contains a new function that should ensure that a background app refresh is performed once a day. With the update the Corona-Warn-App also works again on all devices that were stuck with the [error "Exposure logging not available in your region"](https://www.coronawarn.app/en/faq/#iOS_136).
