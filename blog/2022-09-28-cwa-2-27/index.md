The project team of the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), Deutsche Telekom, and SAP have released version 2.27 of the Corona-Warn-App (CWA). With this update, the team is adapting the CWA to the [new German Infection Protection Act](https://www.bundesregierung.de/breg-de/themen/coronavirus/infektionsschutzgesetz-2068856) (German only), which applies from October 01, 2022. This affects the **display of the proof of status** and the **information on the users' vaccination status**. In addition, the project team has prepared the CWA to display mandatory mask-wearing in the app and enables the export of single certificates that were not issued in Germany.


<!-- overview -->


With version 2.27, the project team has removed the **display of the proof of status (3G, 3G+, 2G, 2G+) from digital COVID certificates**, as there are currently no measures and requirements linked to the G-status. The text box in the CWA informs users accordingly: *"Proof of status is currently not relevant and therefore not shown by the app"*.

Furthermore, the **textbox on the vaccination status** in the detail view of the certificate area shows users their vaccination status based on the new Infection Protection Act. Previously, complete vaccination protection was usually guaranteed with two vaccinations, for example. As of October 01, three vaccinations (two vaccinations with recovery) are required according to the Infection Protection Act. 

In addition, as of version 2.27, users have the option of **exporting individual certificates that were not issued in Germany.** Previously, this was only possible for certificates from Germany. Certificates that are blocked are still excluded from the export. More information about certificate export can be found in the blog posts for [version 2.10](/en/blog/2021-09-22-cwa-version-2-10/) and [version 2.24](/en/blog/2022-06-29-cwa-2-24/). 

With version 2.27, the project team has also **prepared the CWA to display mandatory mask-wearing**. This allows users to have the app display whether or not they are exempt from the requirement to wear a mask in certain locations in the state in which they are located. However, the corresponding display will only appear in the CWA if at least one federal state adopts extended rules on mandatory mask-wearing. More information can be found in the app itself and in the [FAQs](/en/faq/results/#mask_rules).

Version 2.27, like previous versions, will be rolled out to all users in stages over 48 hours. iOS users can now download the latest app version manually from the Apple Store. The Google Play Store does not offer the option of triggering a manual update. The new version of the Corona-Warn-App will be available to users here within the next 48 hours.
