During the course of regular tests on the Corona warning app, developers today discovered a problem in the Apple operating system iOS 13.7, relating to the determination of the risk values. The iOS version released by Apple on September 1 may lead to confusing risk calculations for a small number of users. In some cases, the app may show some users that they were exposed to a higher risk than was actually the case. 
<!-- overview -->

The developers have sent the test results to Apple for further analysis. Currently Apple and the developers are working hard on a solution to ensure that the affected users receive a correctly calculated risk determination.

All users of Android devices and Apple devices with an iOS version up to and including 13.6.1 are not affected by this bug.
