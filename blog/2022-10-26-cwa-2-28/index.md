The project team of the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), Deutsche Telekom, and SAP have **released version 2.28 of the Corona-Warn-App (CWA)**. With the update, the team has added the tile “Pandemic Radar” to the statistics area. In addition, a short text in the detail view on the vaccination status now provides more information about the vaccination status for children under the age of 12 in accordance with the current German infection protection law.  


<!-- overview -->

Users can use the new tile “Pandemic Radar” to go to the [corresponding RKI website](https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Situationsberichte/COVID-19-Trends/COVID-19-Trends.html?__blob=publicationFile#/home) (German only). There, they can find more statistics on relevant key figures for the pandemic, for example, the viral load in wastewater. The pandemic radar is updated daily (Mondays-Fridays).

As the pandemic radar brings together a lot of important, detailed information to assess the current situation, the project team has added the new tile in the first place of the statistics section in the CWA. 

The project team has also added a short text in the detail view on the vaccination status that explains that there are **currently no restrictions for children under the age of 12 and all other persons** under federal law that are **linked to the status “full vaccination protection”**, which is shown in the app. 

Version 2.28, like previous versions, will be rolled out to all users in stages over 48 hours. iOS users can now download the latest app version manually from the Apple Store. The Google Play Store does not offer the option of triggering a manual update. The new version of the Corona-Warn-App will be available to users here within the next 48 hours.
