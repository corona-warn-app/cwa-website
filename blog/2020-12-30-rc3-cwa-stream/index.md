The Corona-Warn-App is a useful, digital tool that warns users of high-risk encounters during the pandemic. The processes in the background, however, remain more or less invisible to most users. In a **livestream for the virtual Chaos Communication Congress (rC3)**, Thomas Klingbeil, SAP Solution Architect for the Corona-Warn-App, explains how the app works in the backend.
 
<!-- overview -->

How does the app communicate with the backend? How is data protection ensured? And how does the risk calculation work? For anyone interested in the technology behind the Corona-Warn-App, Thomas Klingbeil provides answers [**in this video**](https://youtu.be/TIXsOIrp1dg). He also explains how these aspects influence the overall architecture of the app.
