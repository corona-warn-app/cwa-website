The Corona-Warn-App’s next update will be available on February 10, 2021. With version 1.12, the Corona-Warn-App will be compatible with iOS 12.5 so that owners of older iPhones, such as the iPhone 5s, 6, and 6plus, can use the app. Deutsche Telekom and SAP’s project team also adds an exposure history to the contact journal. 
 
<!-- overview -->

In line with current data protection regulations, users will thus receive more precise information on when they had an encounter with low or increased risk. This allows them to better assess the risk they were exposed to. 

As soon as version 1.12 is available, you will find detailed information about the two new features here.
