The project team of the Robert Koch Institute, Deutsche Telekom, and SAP have **released version 3.2 of the Corona-Warn-App (CWA)**. Version 3.2, like previous versions, will be rolled out to all users in stages over 48 hours. iOS users can now download the latest app version manually from the Apple Store. The Google Play Store does not offer the option of triggering a manual update. The new version of the Corona-Warn-App will be available to users here within the next 48 hours.

**Important:** You will only be able to warn others via the CWA until April 30, 2023. All questions and answers on this topic can be found [here](../../faq/results/#ramp_down).
