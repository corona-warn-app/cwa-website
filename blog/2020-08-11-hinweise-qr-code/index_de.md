The Corona-Warn-App has been active for a few weeks now and has been downloaded over 16 million times. An essential part of the app is the QR code procedure, which allows tested users to report test results to the app pseudonymously. So far, this procedure has been used by more than 25,000 people and about 18,500 test results have been transmitted.

If a tested person receives a QR code, they are required to scan it and thus report the results to the app. In the past few days, users have increasingly reported problems when scanning the code. In some cases, error messages appeared, in others the test result could not be retrieved for days. What to do in these cases?

In case an [error message](https://www.coronawarn.app/en/faq/#qr_test) appears, you should check whether your QR code is compatible with the test retrieval system of the Corona-Warn-App. Please check whether the medical personnel have explicitly pointed out to you that it is possible to retrieve the test result with the Corona-Warn-App. Also check if they have used the [correct form](https://github.com/corona-warn-app/cwa-documentation/issues/400#issuecomment-669937832) (10C) and have ticked field 9, which indicates that you agree to the transmission of the test result for Corona-Warn-App purposes.

If [a test result that cannot be retrieved](https://www.coronawarn.app/en/faq/#qr_test), this could be due to gaps in the cooperation between the test laboratory and the application. In this case, the service personnel, test centre or responsible health authority should be contacted to obtain the test result.

If [several QR codes](https://www.coronawarn.app/en/faq/#QRcodes) are available at the same time, e.g. from several family members, you have to be aware that only one code may be used per smartphone. The remaining test results are reported independently of the Corona-Warn-App. To find out which QR code is the correct one, you should read the leaflet carefully.

We’re currently investigating how we can improve the user experience in order to better detect and inform about non-functioning QR Codes.

You can find further "frequently asked questions" as well as more detailed information about QR codes in the [FAQs](https://www.coronawarn.app/en/faq/).
