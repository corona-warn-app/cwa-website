Fraunhofer IIS has conducted numerous tests of the interface vis-a-vis Google and Apple (so-called exposure notification interface) and discussed the results with SAP, Deutsche Telekom and the RKI to adjust the app’s configuration. 

<!-- overview -->

The goal was to check the accuracy with which the exposure notification interface can estimate the duration of, and distance during the encounters in various scenarios (ICE, queue at the supermarket, restaurant, party) in line with RKI's specifications.  

In the last test series, using different mobile devices, about 80 percent of the encounters were recorded correctly. As such, we do not understand the results presented in the Irish study. As far as the Federal Ministry of Health is aware, the Irish study hasn’t been subject to a scientific independent peer review process.
